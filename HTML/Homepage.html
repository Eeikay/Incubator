<p> ABSTRACT
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports to a management station. IDS come in a variety of “flavors” and approach with the goal of detecting suspicious traffic in different ways. There are a number of techniques used for preventing the network from attacks to achieve the security but still few challenges are there which need some concern. Most systems fails to recognize normal behavior and suspicious activity accurately. Sometimes the system inferred the intruder as the normal activity and permits that activity to get into the network due to no pre-set rule against that attack signature which causes the network to be vulnerable to the intrusion activities posed to it, which is the problem in many intrusion detection systems. This project is aimed at the development of a Rule Based Network intrusion detection system using Snort, creating rules defined with the signature of known attacks to counter the activity of intrusion into the network. This project utilized Notepad++ for the creation of rules using the Snort rule syntax, and the software was implemented using windows command prompt. This system was found to have provided increased immunity for the network against intrusion attacks.</p>
